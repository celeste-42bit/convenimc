# Caelestes' ConveniMC - Making Minecraft more convenient and satisfying

## Description

This modpack aims to improve visuals, gameplay mechanics and world features, while providing a coherent close-to-vanilla feeling.
The modlist includes many client-side mods, such as Sodium and Iris for performance boosts and shaders, world-gen modifications for these beautiful mountains and trees and a couple of mechanic and addition mods, to make
the game more misterious and exciting to even the most veteran Minecraft gamers.

## Dependencies and configuration

All dependencies are included and major configs are preset. Feel free to change whatever you need!
Adding shaderpacks and resourcepacks into the appropriate folders can hugely enhance your gameplay experience. Beware the performance impacts though.
